License Grants and Conditions<br>--------------------------------<br><br>2.1. Grants<br><br>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br>non-exclusive license:<br><br>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br>    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br>    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its<br>    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or<br>    as part of a Larger Work; and<br><br>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer<br>    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its<br>    Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br><br>2.2. Effective Date<br><br>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<br>become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<br>distributes such Contribution.<br><br>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br><br>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br>this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>Contributor:<br><br>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br>    or<br><br>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#x27;s<br>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>    Version); or<br><br>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>    its Contributions.<br><br>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br><br>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br><br>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br><br>2.5. Representation<br><br>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br><br>2.6. Fair Use<br><br>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br>equivalents.<br><br>2.7. Conditions<br><br>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br>in Section 2.1.<br><br>3. Responsibilities<br>-------------------<br><br>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br><br>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code<br>Form.<br><br>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br><br>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br><br>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br><br>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>    the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br><br>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br><br>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>License(s).<br><br>3.4. Notices<br><br>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br><br>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br><br>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>jurisdiction.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>5. Termination<br>--------------<br><br>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>Your receipt of the notice.<br><br>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br><br>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>************************************************************************<br>*                                                                      *<br>*  6.

Miscellaneous<br>----------------<br><br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br><br>10. Versions of the License<br>---------------------------<br><br>10.1. New Versions<br><br>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br>distinguishing version number.<br><br>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br><br>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version<br>of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,<br>or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license<br>steward.<br><br>10.3. Modified Versions<br><br>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br>such modified license differs from this License).<br><br>10.4.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License.
